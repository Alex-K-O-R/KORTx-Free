Hello.

This is a readme file of the KORTx Free project.

KORTx Free is the nice frontend engine (even cool, imho). Comes with bunch of handy tools in utilities.

Look into [ KORTx-Free/display/pages/test - variant.html ] for examples. KORTx tools details and descriptions are available on page, in module js-files [ KORTx-Free/display/js/KORTx/core/layers/ ], [ KORTx-Free/display/js/KORTx/core/utilities/ ].

KORTx Free project is free of use (MIT). I will be glad if while using KORTx-Free, you will save a small credits to an author in commentaries.

Thanks for visiting and reading. Have a good luck!
