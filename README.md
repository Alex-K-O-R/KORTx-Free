Hello.

This is a readme file of the KORTx-Free project.

KORTx-Free is planned as really cool frontend engine one day. Currently just a set of handy tools.

Look into [ KORTx-Free/display/pages/test - variant.html ] for examples. KORTx tools details and descriptions are available in module js-files [ KORTx-Free/display/js/KORTx/nodes/ ].

KORTx-Free project is free of use (MIT). I will be glad if while using KORTx-Free, you will save a small credits to an author in commentaries.

Also remember, that gratitude feels good, while currency supports good. :)

If you like KORTx-Free so much or it did come handy and saved you a lot of time (nerves), you may provide some support for me (appreciate for anything)
